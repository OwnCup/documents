### 3. PURPOSES AND LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
   Purposes

There are several purposes of the processing of your personal data by OwnCup. One or more of the following purposes may apply simultaneously:

To provide the OwnCup Services and carry out our contractual obligations (legal ground: performance of a contract and legitimate interest)

OwnCup may process personal data when it is necessary for an interest which is lawful and important for OwnCup.

We use the data for example to process your requests, to communicate with you, to handle your payments or any refunds (where applicable). If you contact our customer service, we will use the information provided by you to answer your questions or solve your complaint.


For our legal obligations (legal ground: compliance with a legal obligation)

OwnCup processes data to enable us to administer and fulfil our obligations under law. This includes data processed for complying with our bookkeeping obligations and providing information to relevant authorities such as tax authorities.

For claims handling and legal processes (legal ground: legitimate interest)

OwnCup may process personal data in relation to claims handling, debt collection and legal processes. We may also process data for the prevention of fraud, misuse of our services and for data, system and network security.

For customer communication and marketing (legal ground: legitimate interest)

OwnCup processes your personal data to contact you regarding the OwnCup Services and to inform you of changes relating to them. Your personal data are also used for the purposes of marketing the OwnCup Services to you. Legitimate interest is the basis for processing e.g. when we personalize our offerings and provide you with services which are more relevant to you and when we analyze information on your interests and feedback to develop our services.

For quality improvement and trend analysis (legal ground: legitimate interest)

We may also process information about your use of the OwnCup Services to improve the quality of the OwnCup Services e.g. by analyzing any trends in the use of the OwnCup Services. In order to ensure that our services are in line with your needs, personal data can be used for things like customer satisfaction surveys. When possible, we will do this using only aggregated, non-personally identifiable data.

Legal grounds for processing

OwnCup processes your personal data to perform our contractual obligations towards you or the Customer Organization and to comply with legal obligations. Furthermore, we process your personal data to pursue our legitimate interest to run, maintain and develop our business and to create and maintain customer relationships. When choosing to use your data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we weigh our own interests against your right to privacy and e.g. provide you with easy to use opt-out from our marketing communications and use pseudonymized or non-personally identifiable data when possible.

In some parts of the OwnCup Services, you may be requested to grant your consent for the processing of personal data. In this event, your personal data is not processed before you give consent and you may withdraw your consent at any time.

### 4. TRANSFER TO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE EUROPE
   OwnCup stores your personal data primarily within the European Economic Area. However, we have service providers and operations in several geographical locations. As such, we and our service providers may transfer your personal data to, or access it in, jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area or the User’s domicile.

We will take steps to ensure that the Users’ personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which they are processed. We provide adequate protection for the transfers of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area through a series of agreements with our service providers based on the Standard Contractual Clauses or through other appropriate safeguards, such as the Privacy Shield Framework.

More information regarding the transfers of personal data may be obtained by contacting us on any of the addresses indicated above.

### 5. RECIPIENTS
   We only share your personal data within the organization of OwnCup if and as far as reasonably necessary for the purposes of this Privacy Statement.

We do not share your personal data with third parties outside of OwnCup’s organization unless one of the following circumstances applies:

*For the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement and to authorized service providers*

To the extent that third parties need access to personal data in order for us and such third parties to perform the OwnCup Services, we provide such third parties with your data. Furthermore, we may provide your personal data to our affiliates or to authorized service providers and partners who perform services for us or in collaboration with us (including data storage, accounting, sales and marketing) to process the data and to payment service providers to process your payments to us.

When data is processed by third parties on behalf of OwnCup, OwnCup has taken the appropriate contractual and organizational measures to ensure that your data are processed exclusively for the purposes specified in this Privacy Statement and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and subject to our instructions and appropriate obligations of confidentiality and security measures.

Please bear in mind that if you provide personal data directly to a third party, such as through a link in the OwnCup Services, the processing is typically based on their policies and standards.

*For legal reasons and legal processes*

We may share your personal data with third parties outside OwnCup if we have a good-faith belief that access to and use of the personal data is reasonably necessary to: (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, and/or court order; (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, crime, security or technical issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of OwnCup, the Users or the public as far as in accordance with the law. When possible, we will inform you about such processing.

*For other legitimate reasons*

If OwnCup is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we may transfer your personal data to the third party involved. However, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of all personal data. We will give notice to all the Users concerned when the personal data are transferred or become subject to a different privacy statement.

*With your explicit consent*

We may share your personal data with third parties outside OwnCup when we have your explicit consent to do so. You have the right to withdraw this consent at all times free of charge by contacting us.

### 6. STORAGE PERIOD
   OwnCup does not store your personal data longer than is legally permitted and necessary for the purposes of providing the OwnCup Services or the relevant parts thereof. The storage period depends on the nature of the information and on the purposes of processing. The maximum period may therefore vary per use. OwnCup takes reasonable steps to keep the personal data accurate and to delete incorrect or unnecessary personal data.

Most personal data relating to a User’s user account with the OwnCup Services will be deleted after a period of 90 days have lapsed after the User has deleted its user account with the OwnCup Services. Thereafter, a part of the personal data relating to a User’s user account with the OwnCup Services may be stored only as long as such processing is required by law or is reasonably necessary for our legal obligations or legitimate interests such as claims handling, bookkeeping, internal reporting and reconciliation purposes. All personal data relating to a User’s user account with the OwnCup Services will be deleted within a period of 10 years after the User has deleted its user account with the OwnCup Services, with the exception of personal data required in certain rare situations such as legal proceedings.

We will store Analytics Data of Users that do not have an account with the OwnCup Services for a period of 90 days.

You have the right to access and be informed about your personal data processed by us. We give you the possibility to view certain data through your user account with the OwnCup Services or request a copy of your personal data using the contact details above.

*Right to withdraw consent*

In case the processing is based on a consent granted by the User, the User may withdraw the consent at any time free of charge. Withdrawing a consent may lead to fewer possibilities to use the OwnCup Services. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

*Right to rectify*

You have the right to have incorrect or incomplete personal data we have stored about you corrected or completed by contacting us. You can correct or update some of your personal data through your user account in the OwnCup Services.

*Right to erasure*

You may also ask us to delete your personal data from our systems for example when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. We will comply with such request unless we have a legitimate ground to not delete the data. Please note that if you want to delete such information, we may not be able to provide you the OwnCup Services or certain features thereof.

*Right to object*

You may have the right to object to certain use of your personal data if such data are processed for other purposes than necessary for the performance of the OwnCup Services or for compliance with a legal obligation. For example, you can request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing or profiling purposes based on legitimate interest. If you object to the further processing of your personal data, this may lead to fewer possibilities to use the OwnCup Services.

*Right to restriction of processing*

You may request us to restrict processing of personal data for example when your data erasure, rectification or objection requests are pending and/or when we do not have legitimate grounds to process your data. When the processing has been restricted, your data will only be stored and not processed further. For example, if you contest the accuracy of your data, such data will be restricted from processing until it is ensured that the data is accurate. This may however lead to fewer possibilities to use the OwnCup Services.

*Right to data portability*

When processing is carried out by automated means and based on a contract or consent, you have the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us yourself in a structured and commonly used format and to independently transmit those data to a third party.

The User has the right to prohibit us from using the User’s personal data for direct marketing purposes, market research and profiling made for direct marketing purposes anytime by contacting us on the addresses indicated above or by using the functionalities of the OwnCup Services (on Profile tab) or the unsubscribe possibility offered in connection with any direct marketing messages.

### 11. LODGING A COMPLAINT
In case the User considers our processing of personal data to be inconsistent with the applicable data protection laws, the User may lodge a complaint with the local supervisory authority for data protection of the User’s country of domicile.

### 12. INFORMATION SECURITY
We use administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal data we collect and process. Measures include for example, where appropriate, encryption, pseudonymization, firewalls, secure facilities and access right systems. Our security controls are designed to maintain an appropriate level of data confidentiality, integrity, availability, resilience and ability to restore the data. We regularly test the OwnCup Services, systems, and other assets for security vulnerabilities.

Should despite of the security measures, a security breach occur that is likely to have negative effects to the privacy of the Users, we will inform the relevant Users and other affected parties, as well as relevant authorities when required by applicable data protection laws, about the breach as soon as possible.
